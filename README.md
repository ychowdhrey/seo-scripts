# SEO Scripts üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A collection of lightweight Python/Colab scripts for automating SEO tasks, audits, and experiments.  
These are not full tools‚Äîjust quick utilities to save time and test ideas.

## Scripts Included
| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Meta & Title Extractor** | Pulls `<title>` tags and `<meta name="description">` from a list of URLs or sitemap <br> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ychowdhrey/seo-scripts/blob/main/Meta%20%26%20Title%20Extractor.ipynb) |


## Usage
Most scripts are written in Python and tested in **Google Colab**.  
You can open them in Colab, upload your URL list or dataset, and run instantly.  

## Why this repo?
Instead of keeping SEO scripts scattered across Colab notebooks, this repo centralizes them for reuse and sharing.
