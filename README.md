# SEO Scripts 🕵️‍♂️

A collection of lightweight Python/Colab scripts for automating SEO tasks, audits, and experiments.  
These are not full tools—just quick utilities to save time and test ideas.

## Scripts Included
- **Meta & Title Extractor** → 
Pulls `<title>` tags and `<meta name="description">` content from a list of URLs or a sitemap.

## Usage
Most scripts are written in Python and tested in **Google Colab**.  
You can open them in Colab, upload your URL list or dataset, and run instantly.  

## Why this repo?
Instead of keeping SEO scripts scattered across Colab notebooks, this repo centralizes them for reuse and sharing.
